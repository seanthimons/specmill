# Propose editable configuration from a schema

Discover every operation, group by its first tag, and propose project
and service YAML without generating endpoint functions.

## Usage

``` r
configure_client(root, schema, package = NULL,
    naming = c("operation_id", "tag_prefix"),
    group_by = c("tag", "none"),
    mode = c("plan", "apply"),
    name_case = c("asis", "snake_case", "camel_case", "pascal_case",
        "screaming_snake_case", "dot_case"))
```

## Arguments

- root:

  Client directory. Planning does not create it.

- schema:

  Local OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 or Swagger 2.0 JSON, YAML, or YML file, or a
  reviewed configure_apis data frame for multiple APIs.

- package:

  R package name; read from DESCRIPTION when present. A supplied name
  must agree with existing metadata.

- naming:

  Preserve valid operationId names, or use tag-prefixed snake_case.
  Missing or invalid IDs get method/path names. Prefixing removes exact
  tag tokens and their simple plural, not synonyms.

- group_by:

  Group by first operation tag, or keep one default service. Missing
  tags use default. Untagged/default services keep per-function source
  files; other groups configure a shared R file and help family.

- name_case:

  Case convention applied to proposed names: preserve them as-is, or use
  snake_case, camelCase, PascalCase, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE, or dot.case.
  Exact names already reviewed in service YAML are preserved.

- mode:

  Preview by default. Apply creates absent files only; differing
  existing files or colliding tag filenames stop the entire write.

## Value

A list with named YAML/schema text in files, operation assignments in
operations, diagnostics, and changes. Each change contains file, action
(create, unchanged, conflict), before, and after. Schemas with security
declarations get an authentication map from scheme names to proposed
environment-variable names. It contains no tokens; names can be edited
before generation. API keys and HTTP bearer tokens are supported; OAuth
login and refresh are deferred.

## Details

The proposal includes a schema copy, specmill.yml, and apis/\*.yml. Each
service selects exact METHOD /path pairs through selection.include.
Multiple tags use the first tag with a diagnostic. Names and tag
filenames are checked for collisions; reserved runtime names are
diagnosed. Name-collision diagnostics identify every contributing METHOD
/path and use API-qualified names for multi-API proposals. Name
collisions may be written for manual correction but block subsequent
wrapper generation. Edit matching names entries in existing service YAML
and rerun this function; reviewed names are reused across reruns and
schema ordering. Noninteractive runs return diagnostics and never prompt
or silently rename public functions. Unsupported operations stay in the
configuration with their diagnostics. This does not supply transport
implementations or resolve unsupported schema features.

Existing files are never overwritten, even if originally generated. Only
matching reviewed names, including deliberate operation-level name
overrides, are carried into the proposal; other existing settings remain
untouched. Review changes and manually incorporate the desired YAML
edits. Apply with no new files is a no-op. This is initial scaffolding,
not automatic schema-refresh reconciliation. No helper, package
metadata, wrappers, or tests are created by this function; use
initialize_client for a new package.

## Note

Schema copies retain the source format and extension; YAML inputs do not
create converted JSON sidecars. For a reviewed multi-API data frame, the
proposal contains one apis/\<api\>.yml per included API. Each file holds
shared schema, selection, helper, authentication and default settings
plus nested tag groups. Groups inherit API settings and cannot re-enable
project- or API-excluded methods or paths. Existing flat service files
remain supported.
