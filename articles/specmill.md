# Start a new API client

specmill turns local API schemas and reviewed YAML policy into R
wrappers, documentation, and request contract tests. It is a
**development dependency**: people installing your generated package do
not need specmill. Your package owns HTTP requests, authentication,
response parsing, and runtime hooks.

This walkthrough creates a temporary catalogue client and checks it
without contacting a service. Every evaluated example runs when this
guide is built. For an existing package, including ComptoxR, use [Adopt
an existing
client](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/articles/existing-clients.md)
instead of initialization.

## 1. Install the development tools

Run this once in R. The tagged release makes the tutorial reproducible:

``` r

install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('seanthimons/specmill@v0.1.4')
install.packages(c('httr2', 'testthat', 'devtools'))
```

If a project supplies an installer and toolkit lock, use those instead:
they select the version reviewed for that project. In a local specmill
source checkout, `devtools::install('.')` installs the checked-out
version. Start a fresh R session after changing an already loaded
version.

``` r

packageVersion('specmill')
#> [1] '0.1.4'
```

You also need R package build tools appropriate to your operating system
when installing dependencies from source. The tutorial itself needs no
credentials.

## 2. Choose a local schema and a new package directory

Use the bundled OpenAPI example first. It contains four operations: get
an item, list items, create an item, and refresh the catalogue.

``` r

schema <- system.file('catalogue/schema.json', package = 'specmill', mustWork = TRUE)
root <- tempfile('catalogue-client-')
```

`root` is temporary so this guide can be rerun. For your own project,
replace it with an unused permanent directory such as
`C:/projects/catalogueclient` or `~/projects/catalogueclient`, and
replace `schema` with your downloaded JSON schema. Save the schema’s
origin and version in your project; generation reads local files and
does not download or refresh schemas.

## 3. Initialize the package

Supply your own metadata and the service’s real base URL. The example
URL below is a placeholder and is never contacted in this guide.

``` r

created <- specmill::initialize_client(
  root, schema,
  package = 'catalogueclient',
  title = 'Catalogue API Client',
  author = list(given = 'Example', family = 'Maintainer', email = 'you@example.org'),
  license = 'MIT + file LICENSE',
  base_url = 'https://api.example.org',
  name_case = 'snake_case'
)
list.files(root, recursive = TRUE, all.files = TRUE)
#>  [1] ".Rbuildignore"                      ".specmill/helpers/api_request.json"
#>  [3] ".specmill/manifest.json"            "apis/default.yml"                  
#>  [5] "DESCRIPTION"                        "LICENSE"                           
#>  [7] "NAMESPACE"                          "R/api_request.R"                   
#>  [9] "schema/openapi.json"                "specmill.yml"
```

Initialization writes immediately and refuses existing-file conflicts.
It creates:

| File | What you maintain |
|----|----|
| `DESCRIPTION`, `LICENSE` | Package identity, dependencies, and your license |
| `R/api_request.R` | Client-owned httr2 transport for JSON/binary bodies, headers, query values, and generated authentication |
| `schema/openapi.json` | Local copy of the schema |
| `specmill.yml` | Project version and selected service files |
| `apis/<tag>.yml` (or `apis/default.yml` here) | Exact operation selection, editable names, helper, and generation policy |
| `NAMESPACE`, `.Rbuildignore` | Package exports and exclusion of development inputs |
| `.specmill/manifest.json` | Ownership hashes maintained by specmill |

The scaffold declares `httr2` and `jsonlite` as runtime dependencies for
HTTP requests and JSON bodies. Existing packages must declare both
before using the default transport.

Tagged schemas automatically get one service file per first operation
tag, plus grouped source files and help families. This catalogue has no
tags, so it uses `default` and keeps one source file per function. Pass
`naming = 'tag_prefix'` to propose names such as `pet_get_by_id`, or
`group_by = 'none'` to keep one service. `name_case` accepts `asis`,
`snake_case`, `camel_case`, `pascal_case`, `screaming_snake_case`, and
`dot_case`. It changes proposed names only; the editable `names` map in
service YAML remains authoritative. Inspect
`attr(created, 'configuration')$diagnostics` for grouping, naming, and
unsupported-operation findings.
[`configure_client()`](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/reference/configure_client.md)
previews the same configuration without initializing a package or
overwriting existing YAML.

It does not create a Git repository, README, test runner, or pkgdown
site for the client. Those are ordinary package maintenance tasks. Do
not rerun initialization to update a client; edit policy and regenerate
instead.

## 4. Inspect the schema and policy

``` r

parsed <- specmill::read_operations(file.path(root, 'schema/openapi.json'))
names(parsed$operations)
#> [1] "get_item"    "list_items"  "create_item" "refresh"
parsed$diagnostics
#> list()
cat(readLines(file.path(root, 'apis/default.yml')), sep = '\n')
#> id: catalogueclient
#> # Local schema files; patterns are file globs, exclude matches basenames by regex.
#> # All paths resolve from the package root.
#> schemas:
#>   files:
#>   - schema/openapi.json
#>   patterns: []
#>   exclude: []
#> # An operation must pass methods AND include AND not match exclude (path regexes).
#> # Keep only GET and POST below to omit PUT/PATCH/DELETE wrappers.
#> # Leave their include/name entries in place; regeneration removes unchanged owned output.
#> # An empty include selects nothing; remove include to allow every matching operation.
#> selection:
#>   methods:
#>   - GET
#>   - POST
#>   - PUT
#>   - PATCH
#>   - DELETE
#>   - HEAD
#>   - OPTIONS
#>   - TRACE
#>   exclude: []
#>   include:
#>   - GET /items
#>   - POST /items
#>   - GET /items/{item_id}
#>   - POST /refresh
#> # Edit the public R function names here; keys stay METHOD /original/path.
#> names:
#>   GET /items: list_items
#>   POST /items: create_item
#>   GET /items/{item_id}: get_item
#>   POST /refresh: refresh
#> # Shared operation settings. Per-operation settings below override these.
#> # file groups wrappers in one R file; omit it for one file per function.
#> # Example: add file: R/endpoints.R under defaults.
#> # docs can set title, description, return, parameters, examples, tags and lifecycle.
#> defaults: {}
#> # Optional overrides keyed by METHOD /original/path. Replace {} with entries.
#> # Each entry can set file, helper, parameters, parameter_order and docs.
#> # parameters keys use the original location and name, e.g. "query limit".
#> # Example parameter setting: {name: max_results, default: 10, description: Maximum results.}
#> # Advanced facades use inputs, extra_parameters and request.arguments mappings.
#> operations: {}
#> # Inherited from specmill.yml; uncomment to override for this service:
#> # helper: api_request
#> # documentation: true
#> # Optional hooks: define client functions before enabling these settings.
#> # hooks: {} # Public wrapper name -> pre_request/post_response hook-name sequences.
#> # hook_callback: run_hook
#> # hook_config: inst/hooks.yml # Alternative to inline hooks, not both.
#> # prepare: prepare_operation # Development callback; pass an explicit callbacks environment.
#> # policy_version: "1" # Your review label, recorded in generation metadata.
#> # Optional fixed request expectations for generated tests:
#> # contracts: {} # Public wrapper name -> fixed request expectations.
#> # contracts_file: tests/testthat/contracts.rds
#> # response_fixture: {} # Mock response used by inline single-call contracts.
#> # Full configuration examples: https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/articles/configuration.html
```

An empty diagnostics list means these operations fit the supported
parser subset. It does not prove the service works. Review diagnostics
before using real schemas; see [Supported schemas and
troubleshooting](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/articles/troubleshooting.md).

The service’s `documentation: true` enables roxygen comments, help
pages, and exports during generation.
[Configuration](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/articles/configuration.md)
explains how to select methods, exclude paths, name functions, and
improve their help and examples.

## 5. Preview changes before applying them

``` r

plan <- specmill::generate_client(root, config = 'specmill.yml', mode = 'plan')
data.frame(
  file = vapply(plan$files, `[[`, character(1), 'file'),
  action = vapply(plan$files, `[[`, character(1), 'action')
)
#>                       file action
#> 1             R/get_item.R  write
#> 2           R/list_items.R  write
#> 3          R/create_item.R  write
#> 4              R/refresh.R  write
#> 5                NAMESPACE  write
#> 6       man/create_item.Rd  write
#> 7          man/get_item.Rd  write
#> 8        man/list_items.Rd  write
#> 9           man/refresh.Rd  write
#> 10 .specmill/manifest.json  write
stopifnot(length(plan$operations) == 4L, !length(plan$diagnostics))
```

`plan` parses and stages candidate output without changing the client.
Review the file actions, `plan$drift`, and diagnostics. `write` means a
new or changed file, `unchanged` means current output, `protected` needs
your review, and `retained` means a proposed removal is being protected.
An eligible deletion appears as `remove`. Manifest metadata can also
appear in the plan.

## 6. Apply, then check reproducibility

``` r

applied <- specmill::generate_client(root, config = 'specmill.yml', mode = 'apply')
checked <- specmill::generate_client(root, config = 'specmill.yml', mode = 'check')
stopifnot(all(vapply(
  checked$files, function(x) x$action %in% c('unchanged', 'retained'), logical(1)
)))
```

You now have four wrapper files in `R/`, their help pages in `man/`, and
exports in `NAMESPACE`. `check` returns normally when output is current
and raises an error when it is stale or protected. It is the default
mode of
[`generate_client()`](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/reference/generate_client.md).
A successful check does not mean tests were run or that every selected
schema operation is supported; inspect diagnostics too.

Edit YAML policy or your client helper to change behavior. Editing a
generated wrapper makes its recorded hash differ and protects it from
replacement.

## 7. Verify a wrapper without sending HTTP

For this small demonstration, source the helper and one wrapper into a
private environment, then replace the helper there with a recorder. The
generated client source has no runtime dependency on specmill.

``` r

runtime <- new.env(parent = baseenv())
sys.source(file.path(root, 'R/api_request.R'), runtime)
sys.source(file.path(root, 'R/get_item.R'), runtime)
captured <- NULL
runtime$api_request <- function(...) {
  captured <<- list(...)
  list(id = 'item-1')
}
result <- runtime$get_item(item_id = 'item-1', language = 'en')
stopifnot(
  identical(result, list(id = 'item-1')),
  identical(captured, list(
    method = 'GET', path = '/items/{item_id}',
    path_params = list(item_id = 'item-1'), query = list(language = 'en'), body = NULL,
        request_controls = list(timeout = 30L, max_retries = 0L, retry_writes = FALSE),
        server = list(diagnostic = 'Relative server URL requires a recorded origin or explicit base URL override')
  ))
)
result
#> $id
#> [1] "item-1"
```

This checks the wrapper-to-helper contract. Follow [Write and run
contract
tests](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/articles/testing.md) to
persist fixed expectations in the package and run them with testthat.
Transport tests are separate: they verify the final URL, headers,
serialized body, and response handling.

## 8. Install and use your client

For schemas with API-key or HTTP bearer security, initialization also
proposes an `authentication` map in `specmill.yml`. Generation creates
`R/api_auth.R` with `set_api_token()` and `api_token()`. Configure the
token at runtime; keep it out of YAML. Public endpoints need no token.
OAuth login and refresh are deferred. See the [configuration
guide](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/articles/configuration.md)
for setup and persistence.

After configuring the actual service and any required credentials, run:

``` r

devtools::install(root)
help('get_item', package = 'catalogueclient')
catalogueclient::get_item(item_id = 'a-real-id', language = 'en')
```

The last call sends a real request. The default helper performs one
request, including when an argument is named `page`. It returns JSON
objects and arrays as R lists, JSON scalars as their corresponding R
scalars, text/SVG as strings, binary as raw bytes, and empty bodies or
JSON `null` as `NULL`. It raises errors for HTTP failures or malformed
nonempty JSON. Those errors report the status and response media type
without including the request URL, response body, or credential values.
A missing or unrecognized `Content-Type` returns raw bytes. A JSON
`Content-Type` with a non-JSON body is a decode error, while a text type
always returns text even if its body happens to contain JSON. The parser
records declared response media and schema metadata, but runtime
decoding follows the actual `Content-Type`. The generator does not pass
declared response schemas to the helper or validate response bodies
against them. Such validation would need an explicit generated helper
argument and remains unsupported. Credentials, pagination, batching, and
service-specific validation belong in the client. Optional
[`paginated()`](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/reference/paginated.md)
companions support explicitly configured page/offset and cursor
retrieval, with
[`paginated_links()`](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/reference/paginated_links.md)
for next links; see [pagination
configuration](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/articles/configuration.html#pagination).
New helpers expose timeout, URL override, and bounded safe retries
through one package-scoped R option; see the [request controls
guide](https://github.com/seanthimons/specmill#generated-client-request-controls).
Existing client-owned helpers require an explicit update to adopt these
controls.

## 9. Save the project and maintain it

Commit the schema, YAML policy, client helper, generated
source/help/tests, and `.specmill/manifest.json` together. Keep the
manifest tracked: it establishes which output can be updated safely.
Keep credentials outside tracked files. Add a package test runner as
shown in the testing guide.

When a schema or policy changes, repeat **plan -\> review -\> apply -\>
check -\> tests**. See [Routine maintenance and
CI](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/articles/maintenance.md) for
thin commands, schema comparisons, coverage reports, and building
documentation for your client.
