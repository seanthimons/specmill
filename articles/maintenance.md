# Routine maintenance and CI

Use the same loop for new and existing clients: **update inputs -\> plan
-\> review -\> apply -\> check -\> test -\> commit**. Schemas, service
policy, callbacks, fixed fixtures, output, `.specmill/helpers/`, and
`.specmill/manifest.json` form one reviewed change. For a toolkit
upgrade, follow the [existing-client upgrade
workflow](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/articles/existing-clients.html#update-an-already-configured-client).
Normal generation does not update client-owned request helpers or
session controls.

## 1. Review schema changes

Keep the old schema snapshot while downloading the new one using your
client’s own acquisition process. Use the same filename and selection
policy for both versions. For example, place `catalogue.json` in
`schema-before/` and `schema-after/`:

``` r

selection <- list(methods = c('GET', 'POST'), exclude = '^/internal/')
diff <- specmill::schema_diff(
  '/path/to/schema-before', '/path/to/schema-after',
  policies = list('catalogue.json' = selection)
)
cat(specmill::format_diff_markdown(diff))
specmill::count_diff_changes(diff)
```

[`schema_diff()`](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/reference/schema_diff.md)
compares method/path identities and canonical data including reachable
local references and response shapes. Changed contracts enter the
breaking-change report lane conservatively for review. Parsing failures
stop comparison. These labels do not prove runtime compatibility.

For parsed operation records, `compare_operations(old, new)` gives a
smaller report of additions, removals, changed parameters/bodies, and
unknown response compatibility. Unsupported operations remain parser
diagnostics, so review them alongside any comparison.

Compare schema revisions under a fixed policy, then review policy
changes separately. Otherwise, changing an exclusion can look like an
upstream deletion. Generation does not automatically delete an
implementation merely because an operation disappears from an
unsupported or changed schema. Eligible removal comes from explicit
exclusions or reconciled renames and requires verified ownership.

Naming conventions are proposal-time settings.
[`generate_client()`](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/reference/generate_client.md)
uses the explicit service YAML names and does not reapply `name_case`.
To propose names for new endpoints, run
`configure_client(..., name_case = 'snake_case')`, review its changes,
and copy the accepted mappings into the existing YAML.

## 2. Generate and verify

``` r

root <- normalizePath('/path/to/client', winslash = '/', mustWork = TRUE)
plan <- specmill::generate_client(root, config = 'specmill.yml', mode = 'plan')
plan$files
plan$drift
plan$diagnostics
# After reviewing the change:
specmill::generate_client(root, config = 'specmill.yml', mode = 'apply')
specmill::generate_client(root, config = 'specmill.yml', mode = 'check')
testthat::test_local(root, filter = 'contract-', stop_on_failure = TRUE)
```

Supply the same explicit `callbacks` environment on each call when your
policy uses callbacks. Run the relevant manual/helper tests too.
Reapplying unchanged inputs should produce only unchanged/retained file
actions. Review output diffs before committing; do not hand-edit
generated files to fix a policy error.

## 3. Add a thin sourceable command

Save the following as `dev/generate.R` in a client without an existing
command:

``` r

.client_root <- specmill::script_root('generate.R')
generate_main <- function(root = .client_root, args = commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)) {
  specmill::generation_command(root, args = args, kind = 'stubs')
}
if (sys.nframe() == 0L) generate_main()
```

[`script_root()`](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/reference/generation_command.md)
locates the package from the source frame or Rscript invocation, so the
command works from another working directory. Add explicit callback
loading inside `generate_main()` if needed, as in the existing-client
guide. Source it in R and call `generate_main(args = '--plan')`, or run:

``` sh
Rscript dev/generate.R --plan
Rscript dev/generate.R --check
Rscript dev/generate.R
```

The final command **applies**. Compatibility commands intentionally have
a different default from the core
[`generate_client()`](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/reference/generate_client.md),
which defaults to check.

| Command kind | Preview | Check | Apply |
|----|----|----|----|
| `stubs` (wrappers and documentation) | `--plan` | `--check` | No mode flag |
| `tests` (fixed contract tests) | `--dry-run` | `--check` | `--generate` or no mode flag |

`--help` describes accepted flags. The stubs command accepts legacy
`--rebuild=<prefix>` flags; YAML still controls selection. The tests
command accepts `--force`, which never overrides ownership. Check/apply
test commands fail if any selected operation lacks a fixed contract.
Plan can report the gaps.

For custom orchestration, use `generate_client(artifacts = ...)` to
limit reconciliation to `wrappers`, `tests`, or `documentation`. Shared
ownership and manifest checks still apply.

## 4. Inspect implementation and test gaps

``` r

inspection <- specmill::inspect_client(root)
inspection$coverage
inspection$manual_exports
inspection$diagnostics
inspection$helpers
inspection$protected_sources
```

Coverage counts files and declarations, not passing tests or working
endpoints. Selected unsupported operations remain in totals. Manual
exported wrappers are separate from the schema denominator and still
need their own tests.

For badges and baseline comparisons, create a separate client report
policy:

``` yaml
# dev/coverage.yml
baseline: dev/coverage-baseline.json
groups:
  catalogue:
    services: '^catalogue$'
    label: Catalogue wrappers
    badge: man/figures/catalogue-coverage.json
```

Group `services` values are regex strings matching service IDs. Groups
must partition every configured service exactly once. Create the
baseline’s parent directory before apply. Report-policy filenames passed
as strings are resolved by R against the working directory; make them
explicit with `file.path(root, ...)`:

``` r

specmill::coverage_report(root, file.path(root, 'dev/coverage.yml'))
specmill::coverage_report(root, file.path(root, 'dev/coverage.yml'), mode = 'apply')
specmill::test_gap_report(root, list(
  helpers = list('api_request'), report_dir = 'dev/test-gaps',
  readiness_report = 'dev/readiness-report.json'
))
```

Reports default to read-only plans. Coverage apply writes badges and its
baseline; gap-report apply writes a dated JSON report. Gap reasons
distinguish missing contracts, absent/empty test files, and unsupported
operations. `readiness_report` is a pointer to your canonical audit, not
an audit created by this call.

## 5. Add client-specific checks to CI

CI should install the project’s reviewed toolkit and formatter, then run
generation checks before tests. For a client with no callbacks, an R CI
step can be:

``` r

checked <- specmill::generate_client('.', config = 'specmill.yml', mode = 'check')
stopifnot(length(checked$diagnostics) == 0L)
testthat::test_local('.', stop_on_failure = TRUE)
```

If you intentionally retain unsupported operations, use an explicit
reviewed diagnostic allowance instead of removing the diagnostics gate.
Do not use `continue-on-error` for invalid configuration or schema
parsing before publishing generated output. Generation commands write
existing summary keys to `GITHUB_OUTPUT` when that environment variable
is set; core functions return structured results and errors instead of
choosing a process exit code.

[`check_public_boundary()`](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/reference/check_public_boundary.md)
accepts your forbidden host/file/export/schema regexes and approved
manual-export list.
[`check_client_hooks()`](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/reference/validate_hooks.md)
validates supplied runtime hook declarations against parsed client
definitions. Their reference pages explain arguments and return values.
Keep these policies client-specific.

[`credential_status()`](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/reference/credential_status.md)
and
[`credential_preflight()`](https://seanthimons.github.io/specmill/reference/credential_status.md)
detect absent/placeholder credentials without logging values or making
requests. They cannot prove a key is authorized. Offline generation and
fixed contract tests need no live key.

## 6. Build documentation for your generated client

Set `documentation: true` and write useful `docs` policy before building
the client site. Generation stages roxygen and reconciles `man/` and
`NAMESPACE`; the help pages then become pkgdown reference pages. Add
human-written vignettes for authentication, common workflows, result
interpretation, and errors.

From the **client package root**, install the documentation tools and
initialize pkgdown once:

``` r

install.packages(c('pkgdown', 'usethis', 'rmarkdown', 'knitr'))
usethis::use_pkgdown()
pkgdown::build_site(preview = FALSE)
```

For a GitHub-hosted client, `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()`
configures the publishing workflow and Pages settings. Review the
generated workflow for your default branch. See [usethis’s pkgdown
setup](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_pkgdown.html).

Keep its README short: purpose, installation, one example, and links to
guides. Put sequential workflows in vignettes and per-function detail in
reference docs. Render examples offline; mark real API calls
`eval=FALSE` or use fixed examples that do not contact services.

For **specmill’s own site**, `_pkgdown.yml` defines navigation and
`.github/workflows/pkgdown.yml` builds on pull requests and publishes on
the configured default-branch pushes or manual dispatch. Local build
command:

``` r

pkgdown::build_site(preview = FALSE)
```

Open `docs/index.html` after building. Site output is ignored by Git and
package builds; source articles and help pages are tracked. The workflow
follows the [r-lib pkgdown
example](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2/examples/pkgdown.yaml).
